## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1

  This was a very fun lab due to the fact that this was the first lab that I had 
  to do. It was a fresh experience and through hardships I was able to work things 
  out with my partner. I really did enjoy this as it was the easiest and most beginner 
  friendly lab!

* Lab 7 Part 1

  This lab is also one of my faorites due to the fact I was able to understand most
  of the things needed. With my partner, we tore this down piece by piece and
  eventually finished it! The best part is that we finished in class and felt pretty
  good about it.

* Lab 12 All Parts!

  I really did enjoy this lab as it was my first lab with 3 partners. I was very
  stressed due to the fact that this was my first time with 3 partners but it all
  worked out eventually! Every partner contributed and truly made it a really good
  and final lab!
